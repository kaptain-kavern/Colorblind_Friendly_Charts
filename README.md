This mod came from [this request on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RimWorld/comments/4ujca6/colorblind_mode_the_histroy_is_almost_un_usable)

## Documentation Used
I used informations find on this site : [Color Universal Design (CUD) - How to make figures and presentations that are friendly to Colorblind people](http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/color/)

## Commentary
I would like to say that I'm glad i saw [AxlColeButler](https://www.reddit.com/user/AxlColeButler) suggestion, because as a web-developer i will now apply all that i have learned and try to use barrier-free colour pallet. And as human being it's always rewarding to help somebody ;)
